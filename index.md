## About Me

Hello! My name is Claire Pillar, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I hope to pursue a career in the renewable energy sector; my primary interests are wind power and hydropower. Through my research in the Symbiotic Engineering and Analysis Lab, I have designed and constructed Wave Energy Converter (WEC) prototypes to be implemented at the Aquafort, a fish farm at the University of New Hampshire. The Aquafort is researching raising mussels, trout, and kelp simultaneously to increase the amount of food that can be produced in the same amount of space as traditional agriculture. Designing a system to power the farm with renewable energy will help both the climate and the local farmers who run the aquaculture. As an engineer, my hope is to design solutions that support people and the environment. Outside of engineering, I love backpacking, lifting, cooking, and reading.
