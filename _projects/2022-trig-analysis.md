In my Fluid Mechanics class, my group and I took apart a vacuum cleaner to discover the underlying fluids principles. I researched different types of motors and their applications and performed the specific speed, diameter, and efficiency calculations. Also, I and worked on summarizing this information in a 5 minute video for an introductory fluid mechanics audience.
